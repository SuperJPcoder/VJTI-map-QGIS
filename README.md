## Why VJTI Interactive Campus Map?

The VJTI Interactive Campus Map is a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based solution designed to enhance the navigation and planning experience within Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Mumbai. This project aims to address the lack of a comprehensive spatial representation of the campus, facilitating better accessibility and resource management.

## 📝Project Overview

This project utilizes Quantum GIS (QGIS) to create a detailed, user-friendly, and interactive map of the VJTI campus. By leveraging GIS technology, the map provides a structured, multi-layered representation of campus features, including academic departments, hostels, recreational areas, and essential services.

## 🌍Features

- **Comprehensive Spatial Inventory**: The map includes all buildings, departments, hostels, and open spaces, ensuring a complete representation of the campus.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Users can search for specific locations, retrieve additional information, and customize their viewing experience.
- **Layered Data Representation**: Different campus features are categorized into separate layers for clarity and better visualization.
- **Hover and Click Interactions**: Users can access location details dynamically by hovering over or clicking on elements.
- **Color-coded Landmarks**: Various campus areas are color-coded to enhance readability and ease of navigation.
- **Scalability & Updates**: The map is designed to support future modifications as new facilities are added or existing ones are changed.

## 🔮Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Integration of GPS technology for live navigation and asset tracking within the campus.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Implementation of AI-based pathfinding for optimized campus navigation.
- **Web & Mobile Deployment**: Expansion of the interactive map to accessible web and mobile platforms.
- **Integration with Public Transit**: Connecting the campus map with external transportation services like buses and metro stations.
- **Event-based Updates**: The ability to dynamically highlight event locations for workshops, fests, and seminars.
